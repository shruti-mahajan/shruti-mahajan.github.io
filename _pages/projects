My work as a Research Assistant under Professor Gillian Smith at WPI all through my Masters involved building a prototype for an automated critique system using machine learning to provide students with feedback on their choice-based narrative games using a tool called StudyCrafter. This system provides immediate guidance to students that human experts cannot because of time and cost constraints. This research was published in Experimental AI in games 2019, a workshop part of the 15th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment. In the process of developing this system, I had the opportunity to study students’ interaction with and their response to an AI. I foresee this kind of research being applied to many settings where humans and AI interact such as other educational spaces doctors and AI health systems amongst many others. 

I am currently working on extending this research into my Master’s thesis. I aim to increase plot and story understanding capabilities of the system to give more personalized, intelligent and human-like feedback. Stylometry techniques in the field of Natural Language Processing are used to analyze texts and stories written by authors. Using a similar stylometric analysis on the interactive narratives that students create, I hope to present them with suggestions to meet their plot goals. This system uses MultiLayer Perceptrons and Long Short-Term memory models to learn from previously made games on StudyCrafter and subsequently check if a given in-progress game is fulfilling its goals. This research contributes towards building AI systems that can critique and even co-create narratives.
