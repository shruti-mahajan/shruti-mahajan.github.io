My work as a Research Assistant under Professor Gillian Smith at WPI all through my Masters involved building a prototype for an automated critique system using machine learning to provide students with feedback on their 
choice-based narrative games using a tool called StudyCrafter. This system provides immediate guidance to students that human experts cannot because of time and cost constraints.
In the process of developing this system, I had the opportunity to study students’ interaction with and their response to an AI.
I aim to increase plot and story understanding capabilities of the system to give more personalized, intelligent and human-like feedback. Stylometry techniques in the field of Natural Language Processing are used to analyze texts and stories written by authors. Using a similar stylometric analysis on the interactive narratives that students create, I hope to present them with suggestions to meet their plot goals. This system uses MultiLayer Perceptrons and Long Short-Term memory models to learn from previously made games on StudyCrafter and subsequently check if a given in-progress game is fulfilling its goals. This research contributes towards building AI systems that can critique and even co-create narratives.

AI story expansion
=====

This is an AI that can expand a given paragraph. 
I used Generative Adversarial Networks to achieve this.
The neural networks were trained on a large dataset of short stories available from the project Gutenberg. 
At the end of the project, the model was able to construct sentences with a rough approximation of what the next word could be.
