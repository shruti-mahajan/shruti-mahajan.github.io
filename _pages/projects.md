My work as a Research Assistant under Professor Gillian Smith at WPI involves building a prototype for an automated critique system using machine learning to provide students with feedback on their choice-based narrative games using a tool called [StudyCrafter](https://studycrafter.com/). I aim to increase plot and story understanding capabilities of the system to give more personalized, intelligent and human-like feedback. This system uses MultiLayer Perceptrons and Long Short-Term memory models to learn from previously made games on StudyCrafter and subsequently check if a given in-progress game is fulfilling its goals. This research contributes towards building AI systems that can critique and even co-create narratives.

AI story expansion
=====

This is an AI that can expand a given paragraph. 
It uses Generative Adversarial Networks to achieve this.
The neural networks were trained on a large dataset of short stories available from the project Gutenberg. 
At the end of the project, the model was able to construct sentences with a rough approximation of what the next word could be.
