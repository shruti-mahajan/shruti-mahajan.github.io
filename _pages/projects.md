My work as a Research Assistant under [Professor Gillian Smith at WPI](http://sokath.com/home/) involves building an automated critique system using machine learning to provide students with feedback on their choice-based narrative games using a tool called [StudyCrafter](https://studycrafter.com/). Through user studies, we ivestigate how students are influenced by the AI-based critique. 

User Interfaces for Deaf Users
=====
Conducting human-centered research by, with, and for the American Sign Language-signing Deaf community, requires rethinking current human-computer interaction processes in order to meet their linguistic and cultural needs and expectations. In this project we are working towards designing Novel guidelines for UIs that are primarily designed in ASL. 

AI story expansion
=====

This is an AI system that can expand a given paragraph into a story!
It uses Generative Adversarial Networks to do this.
The neural networks were trained on a large dataset of short stories available from the project Gutenberg. 
At the end of the project, the model was able to construct sentences with a rough approximation of what the next word could be.

Buy and Sell App for WPI students
=====
The application, NewHome and is a platform where users can post items for sale and search for items. Our main intention for NewHome is that it will be a safe space for members of the WPI community to post items. Students are expected to have a valid WPI ID, as the application makes use of Face Recognition to authenticate profiles. This application uses Object Recognition to verify the items being sold.
