I am a Second year MS in CS student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/)

My interests are Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Natural Language Processing. 
I am passionate about applications of AI for education and studying Human AI mental models and interactions. 
Other interdisciplinary areas of interest to me are AI agents understanding and collaboratively composing stories.

I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
