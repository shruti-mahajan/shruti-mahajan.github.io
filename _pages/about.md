I am a PhD in CS student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/)

My interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically Human-AI Interaction and Natural Language Processing. 
I am passionate about applications of AI in education, accesibility and natural language understanding studying Human AI mental models and interactions. 

Other interdisciplinary areas of interest to me are AI agents understanding and collaboratively composing stories.
